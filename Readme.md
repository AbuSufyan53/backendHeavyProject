This backend project is done where **Sir Hitesh Choudhary** [https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbnozY2I4SUg5T09Oam02YWZFY002U1NjWmZKd3xBQ3Jtc0tsNk9KSTJhb1lvcEhqVTJXTWo5RGV5eWtsOGoxSlkwRGhIaUZ4N09Cejd0NkhuMjM0ODlIeWVzbHpjOWNOTkdCXzVWb1lmX0hjaDRGOGFiNFRyVHMyMWhHbmRwa3d4NGhDVmRfSThsU3Z3bHFmRUk1Yw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhiteshchoudhary&v=_u-WgSN5ymU) left.
